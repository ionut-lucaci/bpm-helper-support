# BPM Helper
Play any gig in any old crusty venue!
Can't really tempo-mach fast enough?
Fear the dreaded CDJ850 (or other older players) with no decimals for the tempo slider? 
Have no fear, BPM Helper is here. Just input the BPM of the upcoming track and the target BPM (bpm of the currently playing track) and BPM helper will tell you with dual digit precision what %percentage% you need to increase/decrease your tempo so it can exactly match your target BPM.

Idk what that is but this app is so simple it really collects no data from you whatsoever!
